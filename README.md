## Tech Used

React is a JavaScript library for building fast and interactive UIs.

Vercel is a cloud platform for deploying and scaling React applications.

## How to start

1. Clone the repository

```
  git clone https://github.com/PEC-CSS/acm-fun.git
```

2. Change the working directory

```
  cd acm-fun
```

3. Install dependencies

```
  npm install
```

4. Run the app

```
  npm start
```

5. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the app.

The page will automatically reload when you make changes, and any lint errors will be displayed in the console.

6. Make sure to follow the directory structure while adding a new **game** or **activity**
 - Your game or activity should be created inside a react component, the file for which should be created in `src/pages/games` for games and `src/pages/activities` for activities.
 - The css file for your component must be created inside the `src/styles/pages/games` folder for games and `src/styles/pages/activities` for activities.
 - To ensure that your created component appears on the website, you must add an entry for your game or activity in the `content.js` file present in `src/data` folder.
 - Refer to this [pull request](https://github.com/PEC-CSS/acm-fun/pull/37/files) to get an idea of the changes you need to make. **Do not make any changes other than these unless explicitly required.**

## Docker Setup

This project is Dockerized to ensure seamless development and deployment. Follow the instructions below to build, run, and stop the Docker container.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) should be installed on your system.

### Building the Docker Image

To build the Docker image for this application, navigate to the root of the project (where the Dockerfile is located) and run the following command:

```bash
docker buildx build -t your-app .
```

- **`-t your-app`**: This tags the image with the name `your-app`.
- **`.`**: Refers to the current directory where the Dockerfile and project files are located.

### Running the Docker Container

Once the image is built, you can run the Docker container with the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 your-app
```

- **`-p 3000:3000`**: Maps port 3000 inside the container to port 3000 on your local machine, allowing you to access the app via `http://localhost:3000`.
- **`your-app`**: The name of the Docker image you built.

### Stopping the Docker Container

To stop the running Docker container, first find the container ID or name by running:

```bash
docker ps
```

This will list all running containers. Use the container ID or name in the following command to stop the container:

```bash
docker stop <container_id_or_name>
```

For example:

```bash
docker stop abc123
```


## Notes

- Ensure that you have Docker running before executing these commands.
- If you change the source code, you may need to rebuild the Docker image using the `docker buildx build` command.


### Customization Notes:
- Replace `your-app` with your desired image name.
- Make sure to provide instructions to install Docker if your users might not have it installed.
