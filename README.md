## Tech Used

React is a JavaScript library for building fast and interactive UIs.

Vercel is a cloud platform for deploying and scaling React applications.

## How to start

1. Clone the repository

```
  git clone https://github.com/PEC-CSS/acm-fun.git
```

2. Change the working directory

```
  cd acm-fun
```

3. Install dependencies

```
  npm install
```

4. Run the app

```
  npm start
```

5. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the app.

The page will automatically reload when you make changes, and any lint errors will be displayed in the console.

6. To build for production use the command:

This command bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes. Once the build process is complete, your app is ready to be deployed.
